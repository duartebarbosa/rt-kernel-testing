rt-kernel-testing
=================

This code was used to determine the latency of the kernel.

Usage
------
Simply run "script.sh". Keep in mind permissions and the need of bash.

Personalization
------
You can edit the script at will on the first lines for improved control over iterations and test parameters.

Results
------
The script will compile everything and execute several iterations of the test.
After all the processing done, the script will clean up everything leaving one folder with the results.
The folder name will be the current executing kernel.
